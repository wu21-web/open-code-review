OCR is open source under the Apache-2.0 license. Bug reports, doc fixes,
and code contributions are all welcome. This page is a quick reference;
the canonical version lives in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Ways to contribute

You don't have to write Go to be useful:

- **Bug reports** — open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/issues/new/choose)
  with reproduction steps.
- **Feature requests** — start a thread in
  [Discussions](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/discussions/categories/ideas)
  or open a feature-request issue.
- **Docs** — typo fixes, missing examples, broken links — these PRs
  often merge fastest.
- **Reviewing other PRs** — comments from non-maintainers help reduce
  reviewer load.
- **Code** — bug fixes, performance work, new features.

## Local development setup

### Prerequisites

- [Go ≥ 1.25](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Getting the source

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/open-code-review.git
cd open-code-review
git remote add upstream https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review.git

make build       # writes dist/opencodereview
make test        # LC_ALL=C go test -v -race -count=1 ./...
```

> The `upstream` remote is read-only. Push to `origin` (your fork) and
> open PRs from there.

### Running your local build

```bash
./dist/opencodereview review --preview
```

For convenience, drop a symlink at `~/bin/ocr-dev` pointing at
`dist/opencodereview` so you can invoke `ocr-dev` from any repo.

### Make targets

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make build` | Build for current platform → `dist/opencodereview`. |
| `make build-darwin-amd64` | Cross-compile for macOS Intel. |
| `make build-darwin-arm64` | Cross-compile for macOS Apple Silicon. |
| `make build-linux-amd64` | Cross-compile for Linux x86_64. |
| `make build-linux-arm64` | Cross-compile for Linux ARM64. |
| `make build-windows-amd64` | Cross-compile for Windows x86_64. |
| `make build-windows-arm64` | Cross-compile for Windows ARM64. |
| `make build-all` | All six cross-compiled binaries (linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64). |
| `make sha256sum` | Generate `sha256sum.txt` for build artifacts. |
| `make dist` | `clean → build-all → sha256sum`. What CI runs. |
| `make test` | Run tests with race detector. |
| `make clean` | Remove `dist/`. |

## Branching and commit conventions

### Branch prefixes

| Prefix | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `feat/` | New feature |
| `fix/` | Bug fix |
| `docs/` | Documentation only |
| `refactor/` | Refactor with no behaviour change |
| `test/` | Test-only changes |
| `chore/` | Build / CI / tooling |

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feat/anthropic-streaming
```

### Commit messages

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

[optional body explaining the why]
```

Examples:

```
feat(agent): add support for custom tool definitions
fix(llm): handle timeout errors in Anthropic API calls
docs(readme): clarify endpoint resolution priority
refactor(viewer): extract task-card rendering into helper
```

The same format is used for **PR titles** so they show up cleanly in the
generated changelog.

```

Most contributions touch `internal/agent/`, `internal/tool/`, or
`internal/llm/`. The CLI surface in `cmd/opencodereview/` is
intentionally thin — flag parsing then dispatch to the agent package.

## AI-Assisted Development

We welcome you to use AI-assisted development to make your work easier. However, what we cannot accept is having AI generate code and committing it directly without review, without addressing the redundancies and issues in the AI's output. This not only severely reduces the efficiency of collaboration between reviewers and you, but also hinders PR handling.

Therefore, when you use AI in your development work, you must comply with the following rules.

### Rules:

1. **You must disclose in your initial issue or pull request that you used AI/LLM, as well as the tools/models you used.**
2. You should understand every line of code written by AI and know what the AI did.
3. When a reviewer asks about the reason for a change, you need to explain it, regardless of whether you or the AI wrote it. You must personally answer all maintainer questions and pull request review comments, and may not use AI/LLM.
4. Your PR should not contain repeated cycles like `AI generated -> fixed -> fixed -> fixed`. This may indicate that you did not review the AI-generated code, but instead let the AI fix issues as they arise, over and over.
5. You must review all code, text, and other content generated by AI/LLM yourself before proactively requesting a review from any member.
6. You must not attribute commits to AI/LLM, including through "Assisted-by", "Co-developed-by", or similar trailers.
7. Do not write overly long commit messages. Important information should go in the PR description rather than in collapsed commit messages.
8. If you are unwilling or unable to do all of the above, please close your issue or pull request.

Thanks!

## License headers

Every source file (`.go`, `.sh`, `.js`, `.mjs`, `.ts`, `.tsx`) must include an SPDX license header. After creating new files, run:

```bash
make license-add
```

This automatically adds the required header. CI will reject PRs with missing headers.

## Code quality checks

Before opening a PR:

```bash
make check      # format, lint, and verify license headers
make test       # race-enabled, runs in CI on every push
make build      # smoke test the binary builds
```

CI runs the same set on every push; nothing surprising.

## Adding new tools

A tool has two parts:

1. **JSON definition** in
   [`internal/config/toolsconfig/tools.json`](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/blob/main/internal/config/toolsconfig/tools.json):
   the name, description, and JSON-schema parameters the LLM sees.
2. **Go provider** registered in `internal/tool/definitions.go` with
   the actual implementation.

Both have to be present for a new tool name to work. See [Tools](../tools/)
for the existing six and treat them as templates.

## Adding new rule patterns

Edit `internal/config/rules/system_rules.json` to map a new glob to a
rule doc, and add the corresponding markdown under
`internal/config/rules/rule_docs/`. Rule docs are single-file per
pattern (English). The `language` config only appends a directive to the
system prompt instructing the model to respond in that language; it does
not switch rule-doc files.

## PR process

1. **Open an issue first for big changes.** Aligning on the approach
   beats discovering misalignment in code review.
2. **One logical change per PR.** If you have two unrelated fixes,
   submit two PRs.
3. **Update tests.** Behaviour changes need test coverage — `make test`
   has to pass.
4. **Update docs.** If the change affects flags, config keys, or the
   review pipeline, update both this docs site (in [`docs/`](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review))
   and any relevant inline help.
5. **Fill in the PR template.** A maintainer will review, usually
   within a few business days.

## Tips for Faster PR Reviews

Want your PR to be reviewed and merged quickly? These practices help:

- **Sign the CLA early** — Many first-time contributors get blocked because they miss the CLA bot comment. Sign the Contributor License Agreement as soon as the bot prompts you — your PR cannot be merged without it.
- **Ensure all CI checks pass** — PRs with failing checks will not be reviewed. Run `make test` and `make build` locally before pushing to catch issues early.
- **Keep changes focused and small** — A PR that does one thing well is far easier to review than one that mixes unrelated changes. Smaller PRs get reviewed faster and are less likely to require multiple rounds of revision.
- **Write a clear, accurate description** — Explain *what* changed and *why*. The description must reflect the actual diff — reviewers lose trust when the two don't match. If the scope shifted during development, update the description before requesting review.
- **Include tests for behavior changes** — New features or bug fixes without tests raise questions. Tests demonstrate correctness and help reviewers understand the intended behavior.
- **Follow existing code patterns** — Match the style, naming conventions, and architecture of the surrounding code. Consistency reduces cognitive load for reviewers and avoids style-only review comments.
- **Respond to feedback promptly** — When a reviewer requests changes, address them quickly to keep the review cycle short. If you disagree, explain your reasoning rather than ignoring the comment.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

The project requires the Alibaba Open Source CLA. The first time you
open a PR, a bot will post a link — sign electronically (takes a
minute). Subsequent PRs don't require re-signing.

## First contribution?

Look for issues labeled
[`good first issue`](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/labels/good%20first%20issue)
or [`help wanted`](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/labels/help%20wanted).
Most are small, self-contained, and have enough context in the issue
description to get started.
