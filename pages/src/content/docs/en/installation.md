There are six supported ways to install the `ocr` CLI.

## NPM (recommended)

#### Install

```bash
npm install -g @alibaba-group/open-code-review
```

Pin a specific version:

```bash
npm install -g @alibaba-group/open-code-review@<version>
```

#### Updating

When installed via NPM, `ocr` keeps itself up to date automatically by
default (the static binary opts out of this mechanism). On each `ocr` run,
the wrapper silently checks the registry for the latest version in the
background and upgrades automatically when an update is found, without
affecting the current review. There's an 18-minute cooldown between checks,
tunable with `OCR_UPDATE_INTERVAL` (minutes).

To turn off auto-updates, set `OCR_NO_UPDATE` to any non-empty value:

```bash
export OCR_NO_UPDATE=1
```

#### Uninstalling

```bash
npm uninstall -g @alibaba-group/open-code-review
```

## Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew install open-code-review
```

The formula installs the `ocr` binary built from source.

To upgrade later:

```bash
brew upgrade open-code-review
```

## MacPorts (macOS)

```bash
sudo port install open-code-review
```

The port installs the `ocr` binary built from source.

To upgrade later:

```bash
sudo port upgrade open-code-review
```

## Install script (curl | sh)

A convenience installer that wraps the GitHub Release binary download
(with checksum verification) — handy for CI base images and headless
machines:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://open-codereview.ai/install.sh | sh
```

It honours three environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OCR_INSTALL_DIR` | `/usr/local/bin` | Where to place the `ocr` binary. |
| `OCR_VERSION` | latest release | Pin a specific release tag (e.g. `v1.2.3`). |
| `OCR_GITHUB_MIRROR` | *(unset)* | Download the release binary and its checksum through a GitHub mirror domain (e.g. `gh-proxy.com`). |

The script supports `darwin` and `linux` on `amd64` / `arm64`.

#### Using a GitHub mirror

In regions where network access to GitHub is slow, set `OCR_GITHUB_MIRROR`
to a mirror domain to download the release binary and its checksum through it:

```bash
export OCR_GITHUB_MIRROR='YOUR_MIRROR_DOMAIN'
```

The value must be a bare domain name — no `https://` scheme and no trailing
slash (`gh-proxy.com`, not `https://gh-proxy.com/`). It is used as a *path
prefix* mirror: the binary is fetched from
`https://<mirror>/github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/releases/download/<version>/…`.
Domain-substitution mirrors (e.g. one that rewrites `github.com` to
`hub.example.org`) won't match this shape — use a path-prefix mirror instead.

The mirror covers both the release binary and its `sha256sum.txt` checksum.
Version resolution (when `OCR_VERSION` is unset) still calls the GitHub API
directly, not the mirror. To skip version resolution entirely, pin a version:

```bash
export OCR_VERSION='v1.2.3'
```

> **Security note:** The mirror is a third-party service, so when
> `OCR_GITHUB_MIRROR` is set both the binary and its `sha256sum.txt` are
> downloaded from it. A malicious mirror can therefore serve a tampered
> binary together with a matching checksum; the integrity guarantee does not
> apply in mirror mode. Verify the downloaded file against the upstream
> `sha256sum.txt` on the
> [releases page](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/releases)
> if you cannot trust the mirror.

On Windows (PowerShell 5.1+), use the PowerShell installer instead:

```powershell
irm https://open-codereview.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

It honours the same `OCR_INSTALL_DIR`, `OCR_VERSION`, and
`OCR_GITHUB_MIRROR` variables (set via `$env:OCR_INSTALL_DIR` /
`$env:OCR_VERSION` / `$env:OCR_GITHUB_MIRROR`). The default
install location is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\ocr`.

## GitHub Release binary

If you don't want Node.js, grab the static binary directly from the
[releases page](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/releases):

```bash
# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -Lo ocr https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/releases/latest/download/opencodereview-darwin-arm64
chmod +x ocr && sudo mv ocr /usr/local/bin/ocr

# macOS (Intel)
curl -Lo ocr https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/releases/latest/download/opencodereview-darwin-amd64
chmod +x ocr && sudo mv ocr /usr/local/bin/ocr

# Linux x86_64
curl -Lo ocr https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/releases/latest/download/opencodereview-linux-amd64
chmod +x ocr && sudo mv ocr /usr/local/bin/ocr

# Linux ARM64
curl -Lo ocr https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/releases/latest/download/opencodereview-linux-arm64
chmod +x ocr && sudo mv ocr /usr/local/bin/ocr

# Windows (AMD64)
curl -Lo ocr.exe https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/releases/latest/download/opencodereview-windows-amd64.exe

# Windows (ARM64)
curl -Lo ocr.exe https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/releases/latest/download/opencodereview-windows-arm64.exe
```

Each release also publishes `sha256sum.txt` next to the binaries so you can
verify integrity:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/releases/latest/download/sha256sum.txt
shasum -a 256 -c sha256sum.txt --ignore-missing
```

## Build from source

You only need this path if you're hacking on OCR or running on a platform
without a pre-built binary.

#### Prerequisites

- [Go ≥ 1.25](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

#### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review.git
cd open-code-review
make build              # writes dist/opencodereview
sudo cp dist/opencodereview /usr/local/bin/ocr
```

#### Build for another platform

```bash
make build-linux-amd64
make build-linux-arm64
make build-darwin-amd64
make build-darwin-arm64
make build-windows-amd64   # Windows (x86_64)
make build-windows-arm64   # Windows (ARM64)
make build-all          # all six at once
make sha256sum          # also produce sha256sum.txt
```

`make dist` runs `clean → build-all → sha256sum` and writes a `VERSION`
file alongside the binaries — that's exactly what the release pipeline
runs.

#### Run tests

```bash
make test               # LC_ALL=C go test -v -race -count=1 ./...
```

## Verifying the install

Wherever you got the binary from:

```bash
ocr version             # prints version + git commit + build date
ocr --help              # top-level usage
ocr review --help       # full review-command flag list
```

If you see a "command not found" error, double-check that the install
location is on your `$PATH`:

```bash
which ocr
echo $PATH
```

## Enable Shell Completion (optional)

`ocr` supports tab-completion for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell.

```bash
# bash
source <(ocr completion bash)

# zsh
ocr completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_ocr"
```

See the [CLI Reference](./cli-reference.md#ocr-completion) for fish,
PowerShell, and persistent setup instructions.


## Where OCR stores state

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `~/.opencodereview/config.json` | LLM endpoint, language, telemetry config (managed by `ocr config set`). |
| `~/.opencodereview/rule.json` | Optional global review rules. |
| `~/.opencodereview/sessions/<encoded-repo-path>/<session-id>.jsonl` | Streaming JSONL transcript of every review session, used by `ocr viewer`. |
| `~/.opencodereview/{last-update-check,update.lock,update-available}` | NPM wrapper's background update-check state. The wrapper polls for a newer release (every ~18 min by default) and prints an upgrade hint. Disable with `OCR_NO_UPDATE=1`, or tune the interval with `OCR_UPDATE_INTERVAL` (minutes). Not written by the static binary. |
| `<repo>/.opencodereview/rule.json` | Optional per-project review rules — safe to commit. |

OCR never writes outside `~/.opencodereview/` (besides the transient binary
download via NPM). Removing the directory is a clean uninstall.
