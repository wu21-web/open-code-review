## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment. Please be kind and constructive in all interactions.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute beyond writing code:

- **Report bugs** — Found something broken? Open an issue with reproduction steps.
- **Suggest features** — Have an idea for improvement? You can start a conversation in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/discussions/categories/ideas) or open a [Feature Request](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) issue.
- **Improve documentation** — Fix typos, clarify explanations, or add examples. You can also open a [Documentation Issue](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/issues/new?template=docs_report.yml) to report problems.
- **Review pull requests** — Help us review code from other contributors.
- **Write code** — Fix bugs, add features, or improve performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.25+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub

# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/open-code-review.git
cd open-code-review

# 3. Add upstream remote (for syncing updates from the main repo)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review.git

# 4. Build the project
make build

# 5. Run tests
make test
```

If everything passes, you're ready to contribute.

> **Note:** The `upstream` remote is read-only for contributors — it is used to pull the latest changes from the main repository. You cannot push directly to upstream. All commits must be pushed to your fork (`origin`) and submitted via Pull Request.

### Line Endings

This project enforces LF line endings via `.gitattributes`. Configure Git to normalize line endings automatically:

```bash
git config core.autocrlf input
```

This ensures any CRLF is converted to LF on commit, preventing line-ending issues in CI.

## Development Workflow

### Branching

Create a feature branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

Use prefixes to indicate the type of change:

| Prefix      | Purpose                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `feat/`     | New feature                           |
| `fix/`      | Bug fix                               |
| `docs/`     | Documentation only                    |
| `refactor/` | Code refactoring (no behavior change) |
| `test/`     | Adding or updating tests              |
| `chore/`    | Build, CI, or tooling changes         |

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

[optional body]
```

Examples:

```
feat(agent): add support for custom tool definitions
fix(llm): handle timeout errors in Anthropic API calls
docs(README): update configuration examples
```

### License Headers

Every source file (`.go`, `.sh`, `.js`, `.mjs`, `.ts`, `.tsx`) must include an SPDX license header. After creating new files, run:

```bash
make license-add
```

This automatically adds the required header. CI will reject PRs with missing headers.

### Code Quality

Before submitting your changes, make sure they pass all checks:

```bash
# Format, lint, and verify license headers
make check

# Run tests with race detection
make test

# Build successfully
make build
```

## AI-Assisted Development

We welcome you to use AI-assisted development to make your work easier. However, what we cannot accept is having AI generate code and committing it directly without review, without addressing the redundancies and issues in the AI's output. This not only severely reduces the efficiency of collaboration between reviewers and you, but also hinders PR handling.

Therefore, when you use AI in your development work, you must comply with the following rules.

### Rules:

1. **You must disclose in your initial issue or pull request that you used AI/LLM, as well as the tools/models you used.**
2. You should understand every line of code written by AI and know what the AI did.
3. When a reviewer asks about the reason for a change, you need to explain it, regardless of whether you or the AI wrote it. You must personally answer all maintainer questions and pull request review comments, and may not use AI/LLM.
4. Your PR should not contain repeated cycles like `AI generated -> fixed -> fixed -> fixed`. This may indicate that you did not review the AI-generated code, but instead let the AI fix issues as they arise, over and over.
5. You must review all code, text, and other content generated by AI/LLM yourself before proactively requesting a review from any member.
6. You must not attribute commits to AI/LLM, including through "Assisted-by", "Co-developed-by", or similar trailers.
7. Do not write overly long commit messages. Important information should go in the PR description rather than in collapsed commit messages.
8. If you are unwilling or unable to do all of the above, please close your issue or pull request.

Thanks!

## Contributing to Documentation

Documentation is a crucial part of OpenCodeReview. We welcome improvements to README files, inline code comments, configuration examples, and any user-facing text.

### What Counts as a Documentation Contribution

- Fixing typos, grammar errors, or broken links
- Clarifying confusing explanations or adding missing context
- Adding usage examples for commands or configuration options
- Updating outdated content (e.g., after a feature change)
- Translating or improving localized documentation (`README.zh-CN.md`, `README.ja-JP.md`, `README.ko-KR.md`, `README.ru-RU.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.zh-CN.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.ja-JP.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.ko-KR.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.ru-RU.md`)

### Documentation Workflow

1. If you spot an issue but don't plan to fix it yourself, open a [Documentation Issue](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/issues/new?template=docs_report.yml).
2. If you'd like to fix it, fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a PR with the `docs/` branch prefix (e.g., `docs/fix-config-example`).
3. Documentation-only PRs don't require test changes, but please verify that any commands or code snippets you include are accurate.

### Documentation Files

| File                    | Purpose                              |

## Submitting Changes

### Opening an Issue

Before working on a significant change, please open an issue first to discuss the approach. This prevents duplicate work and ensures your contribution aligns with the project's direction.

When reporting a bug, include:

1. OpenCodeReview version (`ocr version`)
2. OS and architecture
3. Steps to reproduce
4. Expected vs. actual behavior
5. Relevant logs or error messages

### Pull Request Process

1. **Keep PRs focused** — One logical change per PR. If you have multiple independent changes, submit separate PRs.
2. **Write tests** — Add or update tests for any behavior changes.
3. **Update docs** — If your change affects user-facing behavior, update the relevant documentation.
4. **Sign the CLA** — All contributors must sign the Contributor License Agreement before their PR can be merged (see below).
5. **Fill in the PR template** — Describe what your change does and why.

### PR Title Format

Use the same Conventional Commits format as commit messages:

```
feat(agent): add support for custom tool definitions
```

### Review Process

- A maintainer will review your PR, usually within a few business days.
- We may request changes — this is normal and collaborative, not adversarial.
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR.

## Tips for Faster PR Reviews

Want your PR to be reviewed and merged quickly? These practices help:

- **Sign the CLA early** — Many first-time contributors get blocked because they miss the CLA bot comment. Sign the Contributor License Agreement as soon as the bot prompts you — your PR cannot be merged without it.
- **Ensure all CI checks pass** — PRs with failing checks will not be reviewed. Run `make test` and `make build` locally before pushing to catch issues early.
- **Keep changes focused and small** — A PR that does one thing well is far easier to review than one that mixes unrelated changes. Smaller PRs get reviewed faster and are less likely to require multiple rounds of revision.
- **Write a clear, accurate description** — Explain *what* changed and *why*. The description must reflect the actual diff — reviewers lose trust when the two don't match. If the scope shifted during development, update the description before requesting review.
- **Include tests for behavior changes** — New features or bug fixes without tests raise questions. Tests demonstrate correctness and help reviewers understand the intended behavior.
- **Follow existing code patterns** — Match the style, naming conventions, and architecture of the surrounding code. Consistency reduces cognitive load for reviewers and avoids style-only review comments.
- **Respond to feedback promptly** — When a reviewer requests changes, address them quickly to keep the review cycle short. If you disagree, explain your reasoning rather than ignoring the comment.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

We require all contributors to sign the Alibaba Open Source Contributor License Agreement before we can merge your contributions. This ensures that the project can be distributed under its license terms.

When you open your first PR, a CLA bot will post a comment with instructions. Simply follow the link to sign electronically — it only takes a minute.
