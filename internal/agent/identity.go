// to the same immutable commits, so the second diff load cannot disagree with
// the first — which is what lets the resume decision stay entirely before the
// run exists. Without it, a ref that moved after admission would be discovered
// only mid-run, once a child session and manifest were already on disk.

// trace on disk, so the identity has to be available strictly before
// session.New — which writes session_start the moment it is called.
//
// It reproduces the run's selection exactly — the same diff load followed by the
// same two filter passes — because the identity is derived from the filtered,
// sealed selected set, not from every parsed diff. See runIdentity for what
// skipping a pass would cost.
//
// Those filter passes are chatty, and the review that follows in the same
// command prints them again, so this stays silent. stdout.Quiet is safe here for
// the reason it documents: this is pre-flight work on the main goroutine, before
